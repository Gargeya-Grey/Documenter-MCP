# MCP Server Project Plan

## Notes
- The MCP Server automates and enhances code documentation for files, directories, or repositories.
- Key features: documentation presence, format, and completeness checks; evaluation (clarity, consistency, code-comment sync); master documentation file creation.
- Note: Automated generation of missing documentation is not a current goal; focus is on analysis and checking functionality.
- All documentation generation functionality has been removed; only analysis and checking remain in scope.
- All documentation, CLI, and server code updated to remove references to documentation generation; only analysis and checking functionality remain in scope.
- Must support multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C++, Go, etc.).
- Master documentation file should include a hyperlinked table of contents and, for HTML, a search bar.
- Non-functional requirements: performance, scalability, security, usability, extensibility.
- Improved Python parser to better handle method parameters and docstring analysis.

## Task List
- [x] Read and analyze Project Guidelines.md
- [x] Formalize and export a comprehensive plan to plan.md
- [x] Design architecture for MCP Server (modular, extensible)
  - [x] Create requirements.txt for dependencies
  - [x] Set up src/ directory and __init__.py
  - [x] Implement configuration management (config.py)
  - [x] Implement logging setup (logger.py)
  - [x] Define core data models (models.py)
  - [x] Create base parser class and Python parser (parsers/base.py)
- [x] Implement documentation checking (presence, format, completeness)
- [x] Implement documentation evaluation (clarity, consistency, code-comment sync)
- [x] Support multiple programming languages
- [x] Implement master documentation file generation (Markdown, HTML, etc.)
- [x] Add table of contents and inter-file linking
- [x] Add search functionality for HTML output
- [x] Ensure non-functional requirements are addressed
- [x] Fix Python parser to correctly handle method parameters and docstring analysis
- [x] Test with use case example (e.g., calculator.py) focused on analysis/checking functionality
- [x] Focused test of analyze/check functionality with use case example

## Current Goal
Focus on analyze and check functionality only
