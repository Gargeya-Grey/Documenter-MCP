# **MCP Server for Code Documentation: Requirements and Use Case**

## **1\. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the development of a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) Server designed to automate and enhance the process of code documentation. The server will be capable of analyzing individual files, entire directories, or complete code repositories to check, evaluate, and improve existing documentation. A key feature of this server will be its ability to generate a master documentation file, providing a centralized and easily navigable resource for developers.

The primary goal of the MCP Server is to streamline the documentation workflow, ensure consistency, and improve the overall quality of code documentation, thereby enhancing code maintainability and developer collaboration.

## **2\. Functional Requirements**

### **2.1. Documentation Checking**

* **Presence Check:** The server must be able to scan a given code repository, directory, or file and identify code blocks (functions, classes, methods, etc.) that lack documentation.  
* **Format Check:** The server should verify that existing documentation adheres to a configurable, standard format (e.g., Javadoc, JSDoc, reStructuredText, Markdown).  
* **Completeness Check:** The server must ensure that all parameters, return values, and exceptions are documented.

### **2.2. Documentation Evaluation**

* **Clarity and Conciseness:** The server should use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to assess the readability and conciseness of the documentation. It should flag documentation that is overly verbose, ambiguous, or contains grammatical errors.  
* **Consistency Check:** The server must check for consistency in terminology and style across the entire codebase.  
* **Code-Comment Sync:** The server should be able to detect when the code has changed but the corresponding documentation has not been updated.

### **2.3. Documentation Generation**

* **Automated Documentation Creation:** For code blocks that are missing documentation, the server should be able to automatically generate it.  
* **Documentation Improvement:** The server should be able to suggest improvements to existing documentation based on its evaluation.  
* **Multi-language Support:** The server must support a variety of popular programming languages, including but not limited to:  
  * Python  
  * JavaScript/TypeScript  
  * Java  
  * C++  
  * Go

### **2.4. Master Documentation File**

* **File Generation:** The server must be able to generate a single, master documentation file in a user-specified format (e.g., Markdown, HTML).  
* **Table of Contents:** The master file should include a hyperlinked table of contents that allows for easy navigation to the documentation for each file and code block.  
* **Search Functionality:** The generated master file (if in HTML format) should include a search bar to quickly find relevant documentation.  
* **Inter-file Linking:** The server should automatically create hyperlinks between related parts of the documentation.

## **3\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The server should be able to process large codebases in a reasonable amount of time.  
* **Scalability:** The server should be designed to handle a high volume of requests and be scalable to support a growing number of users.  
* **Security:** The server must have robust security measures to protect the code and documentation it processes.  
* **Usability:** The server should be easy to use, with a clear and intuitive interface (if a web interface is provided).  
* **Extensibility:** The server should be designed in a modular way that allows for the easy addition of new features and support for new programming languages.

## **4\. Use Case Example**

### **4.1. Scenario**

A developer has written a simple Python script with a single function but has not yet documented it. The developer wants to use the MCP Server to automatically generate the documentation and create a master documentation file.

### **4.2. The Code (calculator.py)**

def add(x, y):  
    return x \+ y

### **4.3. MCP Server Interaction**

1. **Input:** The developer provides the calculator.py file to the MCP Server.  
2. **Processing:**  
   * The server identifies the add function.  
   * It detects that the function lacks a docstring.  
   * It analyzes the function's parameters (x and y) and its return value.  
   * It generates a docstring in the appropriate format.  
3. **Output (Modified calculator.py):**

def add(x, y):  
    """  
    Adds two numbers together.

    Args:  
        x: The first number.  
        y: The second number.

    Returns:  
        The sum of x and y.  
    """  
    return x \+ y

### **4.4. Master Documentation File Generation**

1. **Input:** The developer requests the generation of a master documentation file in Markdown format.  
2. **Processing:** The server processes the (now documented) calculator.py file and generates a documentation.md file.  
3. **Output (documentation.md):**

\# Project Documentation

\#\# Table of Contents

\* \[calculator.py\](\#calculatorpy)  
    \* \[add(x, y)\](\#addx-y)

\#\# \`calculator.py\`

\#\#\# \`add(x, y)\`

Adds two numbers together.

\*\*Args:\*\*

\* \`x\`: The first number.  
\* \`y\`: The second number.

\*\*Returns:\*\*

The sum of x and y.
